Welcome to my project portfolio showcasing the various data analytics and visualization projects I undertook during my undergraduate studies in the field of data analytics. These projects span a wide array of topics, 
demonstrating my proficiency in statistical analysis, regression techniques, hypothesis testing, and more. Below are highlights from some of the key projects:

Linear and Regression Analysis:
Explored the application of linear regression models to predict outcomes based on independent variables.
Implemented various regression techniques, including simple linear regression and multiple linear regression, to uncover relationships within datasets.

Statistical Tests:
Conducted Z-tests, T-tests, and ANOVA tests to evaluate hypotheses and assess the statistical significance of observed differences.
Leveraged statistical tests to make informed decisions and draw meaningful conclusions from data.

Average Methods and Trend Line Fitting:
Utilized average methods, such as moving averages and weighted averages, to smooth out fluctuations in time-series data.
Explored different techniques to fit trend lines, providing insights into the underlying patterns and trends within datasets.

Data Visualization Techniques:
Employed various data visualization tools and libraries, including Matplotlib and Seaborn, to create compelling visual representations of complex datasets.
Developed interactive and informative visualizations to communicate findings effectively.
