<h1> About the Developer</h1>
<p>

<br>
 My name is Ankan Deb and I am 19 years old (during the creation of this website).<br>
 <img src="self.jpeg" width="100" > <br>
I am an undergraduate student who is pursuing Bachelors in Technology from Shri Ramdeobaba College of Engineering and Management. <br>
Well I created this for some of the reading enthusiasts like you, well I mostly like mysteries and science fictions related stuff so mostly you will find that here and also i have created 
section to choose diferent genres for those of you who have different taste in topics.<br>
Also this is just a testing web page created by a student so all of the links will lead to Amazon web page where you can buy them, and also this is a project work which was guided by Mr. Samir Ajani 
who is my professor who teaches me web designing.<br>
